# MachineLearningScripts
Short scripts that uses Machine Learning algorithms to analyse different datasets.

## Resume of each JupyterNotebook

## Manuscrited Number Classifier
Classifies manuscrited numbers written by different people using a Support Vector Machine Classifier

## Clusterization of Insurance Companies Clients
Clustering the insurance data which contains the annual charges in dollars in function of different data features.
Once we have trained the clusterization algorithm we can include the new clients in the most adecuate cluster for them having an $\\$
algorithm thats works without the need of human supervision.

## Predictions of the Quality of different Wines
Train a Decision Tree Regressor to predict the wine quality from the data obtained in the given url and study the deviations from the predictions to the real labels and the possibility of using a set of models to improve the precision.

## Identification of the Belgium Traffic Signs
Classify the Belgium traffic signs data set with a Neural Network and gives the accuracy of the algorithm.

## Notes: In each notebook you have a more detailled description and all the modules needed in each case.
